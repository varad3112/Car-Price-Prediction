Car Price Prediction with Flask
This project aims to predict the price of cars based on various features using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is deployed using Flask, providing a user-friendly web interface to input car features and get the predicted price.

Features
Prediction Model: Utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing various features of cars such as mileage, brand, model year, etc.
User Interface: Provides a web-based interface built with Flask where users can input car features and obtain the predicted price.
Scalability: Designed to be scalable, allowing for easy integration with larger applications or systems.
